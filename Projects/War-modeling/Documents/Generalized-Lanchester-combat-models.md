## Introduction

In this notebook we present several generalized [Lanchester combat models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws) and use one of them for simulation and calibration examples with data concerning the [Battle of Iwo Jima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima).

**Remark:** The content of this notebook is intentionally theoretically grounded, but short and simple both mathematically and code-wise. 
The author's intent is to develop similar computational workflows for (1) field battles, such as the [Normandy campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord) during Word War II, 1944, or (2) urban warfare, such as the [Second Battle of Fallujah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fallujah), Iraq 2009, or the [Battle of Bakhmut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bakhmut), Ukraine 2023.

The main computational workflows are done with a 
[System Dynamics (SD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) 
software monad implemented in the paclet 
["MonadicSystemDynamics"](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/MonadicSystemDynamics/), [AAp2]. 
That paclet is based on the monad implementation presented in 
["A monad for Epidemiologic Compartmental Modeling Workflows"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2021/01/02/epidemiology-compartmental-modeling-monad/), [AA1]. 
The functions provided by the paclet [AAp2] have the prefix "SDMon", which stands for "**S**ystem **D**ynamics **Mon**ad".

### Why use the Battle of Iwo Jima in examples?

The examples below use the Battle of Iwo Jima because it is convenient both data-wise and mathematics-wise. Here is our reasoning:

- The battle is important for the USA military, and therefore well documented and used in multiple cross-disciplinary contexts.

    - See, for example, mathematical articles like [JE1] and [RS1].

- (Relatively) well-curated data can be found. For example:

    - Sizes of the military forces

    - Battle duration
 
    - Precise timing

- There is no need to:

    - Take care of negative stocks

    - Simulate "will to fight" -- Japanese soldiers fought to the death

        - Japanese Prisoners Of War (POWs) became POWs because they were found unconscious...

Here is the invasion map of Iwo Jima, prepared in February 1945, [DR1]:

## Generalized models

This section presents a translation to English of the introductory paragraphs of [NM1]. The same general model and breakdown is presented in [AS1].

In their most general form, Lanchester models can be described by the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ax + bxy + cy + d, \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= ey + fxy + gx + h
\end{align}
$$

where:

- $a$ and $e$ define the rate of non-combat losses

- $b$ and $f$ define the rate of losses due to exposure to area targets

- $c$ and $g$ are losses due to forward enemy exposure

- $d$ and $h$ are approaching or retreating reserves

To determine the casualties of wars, actual or potential, the following four models are of greatest importance.

#### **1.** ***Lanchester*** proper model (only the coefficients $b$ and $f$ are available)

In this case:

- The number of casualties is proportional to the number of encounters between individuals.

- The number of encounters between individuals of the opposing sides is proportional to the number of victims.

- The number of victims is proportional to the number of encounters between individuals of the opposing parties.

    -  Product of the number of parties: $x \times  y$.

- This interaction is most relevant when the two sides are located in a common territory:

    - Guerrilla warfare, repression, enmity between two ethnic groups, conflict over scarce resources, etc.

#### **2.** ***Osipov*** model (coefficients $a$ and $e$)

- The number of victims is proportional to the number of the opposing side.

- This could be a classic military engagement where the two sides are in contact only on the front lines.

#### **3.** ***Peterson*** model (coefficients $a$ and $e$)

- The number of casualties is determined by the size of one's side.

- This could be a model of the Cold War, where the more submarines are on alert, the more of them die.

#### **4.** ***Brackney*** model (coefficients $a$ and $f$ or $b$ and $e$)

- The casualties of one side is proportional to the number of encounters and the other to the number of its opponent.

- The model was inspired by the Vietnam War and describes asymmetric warfare quite satisfactorily.

    -  I.e. a conflict in which one side is engaged in classical warfare and the other in guerrilla warfare.

--------

## Model "rigidness"

The simplest generalized Lanchester model, with Osipov terms only, is:

$$
\begin{align}
x'(t)=-b y(t), \\
y'(t)=-a x(t).
\end{align}
$$

That model is a "rigid model" that admits an exact solution. (See Arnold's book "«Rigid» and «soft» mathematical models", [VA1].)

Here is the solution:

$$\frac{d x}{d y}=\frac{b y(t)}{a x(t)}$$

$$a x(t) d x =b y(t) d y$$

$$a x(t) ^2- b y(t)^2\text{==}\text{const}$$.

The evolution of army size $x$ and $y$ occurs along the hyperbola given by the equation $a x(t) ^2- b y(t)^2\text{==}\text{const}.$ The war evolves along that hyperbola, hence it depends on the starting point.

The corresponding manifold of hyperbolas is separated by the line $a x = b y$. If the starting point lies above this line, then the hyperbola finishes on the $y$-axis. This means that in the course of the war army $x$ decreases to size zero and army $y$ wins.

**Remark:** Note that if the efficiency coefficients $a$ and $b$ are not constant then the equation $a x = b y$ determines a curve.

Here is an interactive interface that illustrates the properties of the simplest model:

```mathematica
Manipulate[
 ContourPlot[fX[a, x] x - fY[b, y] y, {x, 0, 10}, {y, 0, 10},
  PlotLegends -> Automatic,
  Contours -> Evaluate[Join[{{0, {Red, Thick}}}, DeleteCases[Table[{i, Blue}, {i, -100, 100, 0.25}], {0 | 0., _}]]],
  ContourShading -> False,
  FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}],
 {{a, 0.1, "a, efficiency constant X:"}, 0, 1, 0.001, Appearance -> "Open"},
 {{b, 0.2, "b, efficiency constant Y:"}, 0, 1, 0.001, Appearance -> "Open"},
 {{fX, Sqrt[#1 Sqrt[#2]] &, "efficiency function X:"}, 
   {(Sqrt[#1] &) -> "\!\(\*SqrtBox[\(a\)]\)", 
     (Sqrt[#1 Sqrt[#2]] &) -> "\!\(\*SqrtBox[\(a \*SqrtBox[\(x\)]\)]\)"}, 
  ControlType -> SetterBar},
 {{fY, Sqrt[#1] &, "efficiency function Y:"}, 
   {(Sqrt[#1] &) -> "\!\(\*SqrtBox[\(b\)]\)", 
     (Sqrt[#1 Sqrt[#2]] &) -> "\!\(\*SqrtBox[\(b \*SqrtBox[\(y\)]\)]\)"}, 
  ControlType -> SetterBar}]
```

## SDMon model

In this section we define the general model in a *simple programmatic* *form* using the paclet ["MonadicSystemDynamics"](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/AntonAntonov/MonadicSystemDynamics/), [AAp2].

**Remark:** A better programmatic form would have equation elements that prevent (army) stocks to become negative.

**Remark:** Compared to the previous section, below we follow "wordier" but self-explanatory notation that helps model understanding, evaluation, and enhancements.

Here are the stocks:

```mathematica
aStocks = <|
    X[t] -> "Soldiers of army X", 
    Y[t] -> "Soldiers of army Y" 
   |>;
```

Here are the rates:

```mathematica
aRates = <|
    fireEfficiencyX -> "Efficiency of force X ", 
    fireEfficiencyY -> "Efficiency of force Y", 
    fireEfficiencyXonY -> "Efficiency of force X on Y", 
    fireEfficiencyYonX -> "Efficiency of force Y on X", 
    growthX -> "Growth rate of force X due to new recruits", 
    growthY -> "Growth rate of force Y due to new recruits", 
    diseaseX -> "Disease rate in force X", 
    diseaseY -> "Disease rate in force Y", 
    fireFriendlyX -> "Friendly fire rate in force X", 
    fireFriendlyY -> "Friendly fire rate in force Y" 
   |>;
```

Here are the rules that assign concrete values to the rates:

```mathematica
aRateRules = <|
     fireEfficiencyX -> 0.01, 
     fireEfficiencyY -> 0.015, 
     fireEfficiencyXonY -> 0.05, 
     fireEfficiencyYonX -> 0.03, 
     growthX -> 0, 
     growthY -> 0, 
     diseaseX -> 0.01, 
     diseaseY -> 0.01, 
     fireFriendlyX -> 0.001, 
     fireFriendlyY -> 0.001 
   |>;
```

Initial conditions (number of soldiers):

```mathematica
lsInitConds = {X[0] == 100000, Y[0] == 100000};
```

Lanchester (or Lotka-Volterra) interactions:

```mathematica
lotkaVolterraX = fireEfficiencyYonX*X[t]*Y[t];
lotkaVolterraY = fireEfficiencyXonY*X[t]*Y[t];
```

Osipov interactions:

```mathematica
osipovX = fireEfficiencyY*Y[t];
osipovY = fireEfficiencyX*X[t];
```

Equations:

```mathematica
lsEquations = {
     X'[t] == growthX - diseaseX*X[t] - fireFriendlyX*X[t] - lotkaVolterraX - osipovX, 
     Y'[t] == growthY - diseaseY*Y[t] - fireFriendlyY*Y[t] - lotkaVolterraY - osipovY 
   };
```

Make the model data structure:

```mathematica
model1 = <|
    "Rates" -> aRates, 
    "Stocks" -> aStocks, 
    "RateRules" -> aRateRules, 
    "InitialConditions" -> lsInitConds, 
    "Equations" -> lsEquations 
   |>;
```

Display the model in tabular format:

```mathematica
ModelGridTableForm[model1]
```

## Direct model simulation

Here we follow the equations setup and data in the article [JE1].

**Remark:** The data in [JE1] is later revisited and new computations were made with almost the same results. See [RS1].

```mathematica
Clear[growthIwoJimaX];
growthIwoJimaX[t_] := Piecewise[{{54000, 0 <= t < 1}, {6000, 2 <= t < 3}, {13000, 5 <= t < 6}}, 0]
```

Here we replace the constant term of the first equation in the generalized model with the growth function `growthIwoJimaX`.

```mathematica
model1a = model1 /. growthX -> growthIwoJimaX[t];
```

Here we create the monadic pipeline, put in the fire efficiency rates found in [JE1], simulate the for battles number of days, and plot the result:

```mathematica
sdObj =
  SDMonUnit[]⟹
   SDMonSetSingleSiteModel[model1a]⟹
   SDMonAssignRateRules[<|
     growthY -> 0,
     diseaseX -> 0, diseaseY -> 0,
     fireEfficiencyYonX -> 0, fireEfficiencyXonY -> 0,
     fireEfficiencyX -> 0.0106, fireEfficiencyY -> 0.0544
     |>]⟹
   SDMonAssignInitialConditions[<|X[0] -> 0, Y[0] -> 21000|>]⟹
   SDMonEcho[Style["Model's tabular form:", Bold, Purple, FontSize -> 18, FontFamily -> "Times"]]⟹
   SDMonEchoModelGridTableForm⟹
   SDMonSimulate[35]⟹
   SDMonEcho[Style["Plot simulated stocks evolution:", Bold, Purple, FontSize -> 18, FontFamily -> "Times"]]⟹
   SDMonPlotSolutions[];
```

## Calibration

In this section we show that by using optimization methods such as calibration, we can obtain the same efficiency rates as the ones theoretically computed in [JE1] using the same data.

**Remark:** This should bring some confidence in using SDMon; and since the calibration process is easy to specify, it should encourage SDMon's use for other SD models.

Consider the following ***calibration targets*** that are "time series" each derived via linear interpolation from two data points -- the start and end values of the number of soldiers for each army:

```mathematica
aTargets2 = N@
    <|
     X -> Map[Interpolation[{{0, Total@Map[growthIwoJimaX, Range[0, 36]]}, {35, 51300}}, InterpolationOrder -> 1], Range[0, 35]], 
     Y -> Interpolation[{{0, 21000}, {35, 0}}, InterpolationOrder -> 1] /@ Range[0, 35] 
    |>;
```

```mathematica
ListLinePlot[aTargets2, PlotTheme -> "Detailed"]
```

![04h6tiutk2v18](./Diagrams/Generalized-Lanchester-combat-models/04h6tiutk2v18.png)

Here is the first point of the stock $X$ (USA soldiers):

```mathematica
Total@Map[growthIwoJimaX, Range[0, 35]]

(*73000*)
```

Here is a model setup pipeline:

```mathematica
sdObj2 = 
   SDMonUnit[]⟹
    SDMonSetSingleSiteModel[model1a]⟹
    SDMonAssignRateRules[<|
      growthY -> 0, 
      diseaseX -> 0, diseaseY -> 0, 
      fireEfficiencyYonX -> 0, fireEfficiencyXonY -> 0 
     |>]⟹
    SDMonAssignInitialConditions[<|X[0] -> 0, Y[0] -> 21000|>]⟹
    SDMonEchoModelGridTableForm;
```

![0dn5n2wr30j8p](./Diagrams/Generalized-Lanchester-combat-models/0dn5n2wr30j8p.png)

Here is a calibration pipeline that specifies:

- Target time series of the stocks

- Parameters to calibrate

- Parameter ranges, within which to search for the calibration values

- Distance function from the computed time series to the target time series

- Parameters for [NMinimize](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NMinimize.html)

```mathematica
resCalibration = 
  sdObj2⟹
   SDMonCalibrate[
    "Target" -> KeyTake[aTargets2, {X, Y}], 
    "Parameters" -> <|fireEfficiencyX -> {0, 0.1}, fireEfficiencyY -> {0, 0.1}|>, 
    DistanceFunction -> EuclideanDistance, 
    Method -> {"NelderMead", "PostProcess" -> False}, 
    MaxIterations -> 1000]⟹
   SDMonTakeValue

(*{83614.5, {fireEfficiencyX -> 0.00990159, fireEfficiencyY -> 0.0399577}}*)
```

Here we plot the simulated army sizes using the calibrated values:

```mathematica
sdObj2⟹
  SDMonSimulate[35]⟹
  SDMonAssignRateRules[
   Association@resCalibration[[2]]]⟹
  SDMonEcho[
   Style["Plot simulated stocks evolution with calibrated values:", 
    Bold, Purple, FontSize -> 18, 
    FontFamily -> "Times"]]⟹
  SDMonPlotSolutions[];
```

![06slywccm35ey](./Diagrams/Generalized-Lanchester-combat-models/06slywccm35ey.png)

![1kbgrc3wyhku7](./Diagrams/Generalized-Lanchester-combat-models/1kbgrc3wyhku7.png)

Here we use a more "complicated" distance function that takes only the known points of the time series:

```mathematica
resCalibration2 = 
  sdObj2⟹
   SDMonCalibrate[
    "Target" -> KeyTake[aTargets2, {X, Y}], 
    "Parameters" -> <|fireEfficiencyX -> {0, 0.1}, fireEfficiencyY -> {0, 0.1}|>, 
    DistanceFunction -> (EuclideanDistance[#1[[{1, -1}]], #2[[{1, -1}]]] &), 
    Method -> {"NelderMead", "PostProcess" -> False}, MaxIterations -> 1000]⟹
   SDMonTakeValue

(*{73000., {fireEfficiencyX -> 0.0106351, fireEfficiencyY -> 0.0547895}}*)
```

**Remark:** Note that with that new calibration distance function we get almost the same results as the theoretically computed efficiency rates in [JE1]:

```
<|fireEfficiencyX -> 0.0106, fireEfficiencyY -> 0.0544|>
```

**Remark:** A proper calibration time series for the USA soldier stock $X$ can be obtained from the web page ["Iwo Jima, a look back"](https://www.recordsofwar.com/iwojimahistory/). (The corresponding data ingestion notebook is going to be published soon.)

RECOMMEND CHANGE: **Remark:** A proper calibration time series for the value of USA soldier stock $X$ can be obtained...

## Future plans

Here are a few directions to extend this work into:

- Inclusion of different types of forces

- Simulation of "will to fight"

    - Easy with NDSolve and, hence, with SDMon.

- Inclusion of weapon and ammunition production stocks and related supply rates

    - For example, as in [AA2].

- Modeling the war impact on countries' economics and population.

- Modeling the impact of propaganda.

- Creation of interactive interfaces with knobs for the parameters, and selectors of scenarios based on known battles.
